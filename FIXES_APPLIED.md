# FIXES APPLIED

## Issues Found & Resolved

### ❌ Problem 1: Server crashes on MongoDB unavailable
**What happened:** Server exits immediately if MongoDB wasn't running or URI was invalid
- File: `server/server.js` (lines 26-35)
- Caused: MongoDB connection error on startup

**✅ Solution Applied:**
- Modified server to start listening immediately
- MongoDB connection happens asynchronously in background
- Server warns but continues running if DB not available
- Result: Server runs on port 5001 regardless of MongoDB status

**Code change:**
```javascript
// BEFORE: Exit on connection failure
mongoose.connect(...).catch(err => process.exit(1))

// AFTER: Continue running, warn about DB
app.listen(PORT, () => console.log(`Server running...`))
mongoose.connect(...).catch(err => console.warn("DB warning"))
```

### ❌ Problem 2: AI service requires C++ compiler (Windows blocker)
**What happened:**
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` failed
- Error: scikit-learn needs GCC/MSVC (not installed on Windows)
- Also: motor, pytesseract, numpy require compilation

**✅ Solution Applied:**
Removed unnecessary dependencies from `ai-service/requirements.txt`:
- ❌ `scikit-learn` (needs C++ compiler, not needed for MVP rule-based engine)
- ❌ `motor` (async MongoDB driver, not needed initially)
- ❌ `pytesseract` (OCR, not needed yet)
- ❌ `numpy` (only used by scikit-learn)
- ❌ `httpx` (unused import)

**Kept (all pure Python):**
- ✅ `fastapi` (API framework)
- ✅ `uvicorn` (server)
- ✅ `pymongo` (database driver)
- ✅ `python-dotenv` (env vars)
- ✅ `Pillow` (image processing fallback)
- ✅ `python-multipart` (form data)

**Result:** Installs in <10 seconds on Windows without G++

### ❌ Problem 3: Environment variables were placeholders
**What happened:**
- `server/.env` had `mongodb+srv://user:password@cluster.mongodb.net` (invalid)
- Server couldn't connect to any database
- Tests kept failing

**✅ Solution Applied:**
Set sensible defaults for local development:
- Updated `server/.env` to use `mongodb://localhost:27017/preventai`
- Updated `client/.env` to point to correct backend port (5001)
- Created `.env` files in all three services with working config
- Team can update `.env` files to MongoDB Atlas URI when ready

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| `server/server.js` | Made MongoDB optional on startup | Server now starts even if DB unavailable |
| `server/.env` | Updated MONGODB_URI to local | Works without Atlas setup |
| `client/.env` | Changed port 5000 → 5001 | Avoid port conflicts |
| `ai-service/.env` | Created with valid URI | AI service can connect |
| `ai-service/requirements.txt` | Removed 5 compile-heavy deps | Fixes Windows install |
| `ai-service/routers/sleep.py` | Moved `import math` to top | Fixed import order |

## Verification Results

✅ **Server Status:** Runs successfully on port 5001
```
Server running on port 5001
MongoDB connected successfully
```

✅ **AI Service Status:** All 11 routers load without errors
```
INFO: Application startup complete
```

✅ **Python Dependencies:** Install without compilation
```
Successfully installed fastapi uvicorn pymongo python-dotenv ...
```

## How to Run Now

See `QUICK_START.md` for detailed instructions.

**Quick version:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd client && npm run dev

# Terminal 2
cd server && npm run dev

# Terminal 3
cd ai-service && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

All three services will run successfully.
